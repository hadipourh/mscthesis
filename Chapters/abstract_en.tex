\noindent
In this dissertation, based on 
\cite{kreuzer2009algebraic}
, we present a collection of techniques in algebraic cryptanalysis. After introducing  the basic setup of algebraic attacks and discussing several scenarios for symmetric and public key cryptosystem, we discuss a number of individual methods. In particular, we study the XL, XSL, and MutantXL attacks which are based on linearization techniques for multivariate polynomial system. Next, we study those algebraic attacks which are based on Gr\"{o}bner, and border bases, as well as, attacks based on integer programming techniques and sat solvers.
